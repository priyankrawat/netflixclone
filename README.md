## Netflix Clone Using React (Custom Hooks, Context, Portals), Firebase, Compound & Styled Components 
Demo Link: https://modest-ritchie-56cd43.netlify.app/
This application (a Netflix clone) was built using React (Custom Hooks, Context), Firebase & Styled Components. I have built the following pages within this application: sign in, sign up, browse & lastly the homepage. There are four different pages, some using protected routes with auth listeners. Firebase firestore handles all the data and that data is retrieved using a custom hook; authentication is used on all pages, which is handled by Firebase as well.
